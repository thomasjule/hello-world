Make and commit changes

Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes button.

These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content thatâ€™s different from master.
